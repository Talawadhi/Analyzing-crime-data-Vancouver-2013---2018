In this analysis, I will be generating general stats and try to answer these questions :
Number of Crimes reported each year
Which crime types are the most common?
Which day of the week and month of the year result in the most crimes?
When Does Crime Most Often Happen?
What times of day are police most active?
Which neighborhoods had the most crimes and did that change over the years?
Where are the most dangerous intersections in Vancouver for 2018?
What are the most common crimes in Christmas day and where do they happen?
